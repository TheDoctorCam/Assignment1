(b) 	Thus far, there have been 8 commits done to the repository. 

(c)	The file ".gitignore" was last modified on September 27th, 2017 at 16:31:42.
	This was found using "git log .gitignore"

(d)	These are the following IDs of the commits used to merge the changes from the
	branch "development" to the branch "master":
		7c51277533bcb935b3e63f0a7e1e13dc1eaf0f13
		3af53ff71a194495bea7aeb2767fc1a518683535

(e) 	Two reasons for using branched in a Git repository are the ability to keep
	unstable code from being commited to the master and it also allows a feature's
	history to be cleaned up before merging it with the main branch.

(f)	git status displats the state of the working directory and the staging area while git log displays the commit history.

(g)	git log Weapon.h

(h)	git log -s "file"

(i)	Inheritance is an object taking properties from an existing class, typically with more specific classes
	taking properties from a more generic class.
	
	Polymorphism is a function that can applied to more than one argument, like in C++ with Virtual Functions.
	
	Encapsulation is the creation of new classes by combining structure and behavior, and restricting access
	to implementation details.




7.	The RoleGame prototype is using polymorphism through the virtual destructor in each weapon child class and also
	encapsulation through the weapon class.
